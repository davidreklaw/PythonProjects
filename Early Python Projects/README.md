# Early Python Projects

These projects are some of my first python files from my early programming days

## Packages/Modules

The following modules were used:

1. [Math](https://docs.python.org/3/library/math.html)

2. [Random](https://docs.python.org/3/library/random.html)

3. [Turtle](https://docs.python.org/3/library/turtle.html)

## Coding Style and Guide Lines

These files follow [python coding guide lines](https://github.com/davidreklaw/PythonProjects/blob/main/UWG_Python_Style_Guide.txt) from coding roles given at the University of West Georgia, a copy of the guidelines is provided in this repo. Most files have been reformatted to follow the guide lines. The only thing that doesn't follow the guide lines is the name of the files.

## Files

A lot of these files explore the basics of programming (basic data types, functions, parameters, if statements, and for-loops).

### Area_of_a_Circle.py

This files is a simple that calculates the area of a circle given radius.

### AreaCalculator.py

Giving the user a choice between a circle and a triangle, the area of the respective shape will be calculated

### Fibonacci.py

Given how many numbers the user want, that many number in the sequence will be given

### Kinematics.py

Given a launch velocity and launch angle, the horizontal displacement will be calculated. The user is asked if the object is being launched at the same elevation that it will be landing at. Given this information the program will calculate the vertical displacement if needed.

### Password_Generator.py

This program will generate a given number of passwords of a given length.

### Spiral.py

Using the turtle module this program will draw a spiral that changes colors as the turtle draws.

### Star.py

Using the turtle module this program will draw a spiral the gradually changes to another color.
